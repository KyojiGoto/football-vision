// Helper to construct VNRecognizedObjectObservation for tests if needed, though direct construction is tricky.
// For the purpose of these tests, we are focusing on the logic that consumes these observations,
// rather than the observations themselves.

// Note on Mocking VN Objects:
// Creating full mock instances of Vision objects like VNHumanBodyPose3DObservation
// or even VNRecognizedObjectObservation with all internal states is complex because
// they often lack public initializers for all properties or are class clusters.
// The tests above try to test the *logic that processes the data extracted from these objects*
// rather than testing the Vision framework's ability to create or populate them.
// True unit testing of the completion handlers would involve:
// 1. Making the VNRequest properties in CameraViewModel `internal` or providing testable seams.
// 2. Using a library or manually crafting minimal mock objects that can be passed to the handlers.
// 3. Or, refactoring the processing logic into separate methods that take the *data* (not the observation objects) as input.

// The `requestPermission` test is also limited due to system dependencies.
// A robust solution would involve protocol-based dependency injection for AVCaptureDevice services.
